- Re-added psutil check for memory tracking
- Commented output code
- Implemented StaticDict class for params dict
- Removed redundant input-compression key (now seq-compression)
- Now track low sCF nodes per locus
- Removed locus_scf averaging within locusSCF function (now takes place in imap loop)
- Better status updates during scf calculations

11.08.2021
- Changed name of main script from "phyloacc.py" to "phyloacc_interface.py"
- Added post-processing script, phyloacc_post.py

11.20.2021
- Added run mode option (-r) to let user specify whether to use the species tree model, gene tree model, or adaptively choose based on sCF
- Added --theta and -l options for the input to the gene tree model, which requires a tree with branche lengths in coalescent units. --theta adds to the snakemake pipeline to generate this tree with IQtree and ASTRAL. -l lets the user specify the coalescent tree
- Added the gene tree model rule to the snakemake template
- Changed the resource allocation options so that -p specifies the processes per job (this was previously total number of processes available)

01.24.2021
- Expanded input options to accomodate more PhyloAcc gene tree options
- Added summary plot and HTML generation to interface
